# NeuralPopulationsAndDecisionMaking

[NeuralPopulationsAndDecisionMaking.ipynb](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/NeuralPopulationsAndDecisionMaking/blob/main/NeuralPopulationsAndDecisionMaking.ipynb) is devided into 3 parts:
* Part1: Conection of 2 neurons(excitatory-excitatory, excitatory-inhibitory and inhibitory-inhibitory).
* Part2: An implementation of 5 different currents to be the input of our neurons.
* Part3: A simulation of decision-making process using 2 excitatory and 1 inhibitory populations.

[Report.pdf](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/NeuralPopulationsAndDecisionMaking/blob/main/Report.pdf) contains:
* A complete explanation of required mathematics.
* The results of the project.
