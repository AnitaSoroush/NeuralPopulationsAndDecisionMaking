# NeuronPopulationsAndDecisionMaking

[NeuronPopulationsAndDecisionMaking.ipynb](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/LIF_ALIF_AELIF/blob/main/NeuronPopulationsAndDecisionMaking.ipynb) is devided into 3 parts:
* Part1: Conection of 2 neurons(excitatory-excitatory, excitatory-inhibitory and inhibitory-inhibitory).
* Part2: An implementation of 5 different currents to be the input of our neurons.
* An implementation of Line graphs that represent **membrane potential** of each neuron when exposed to each input current.
* An implementation of Line graphs that represent the **frequency of firing** of each neuron when exposed to each input current.

[Report.pdf](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/LIF_ALIF_AELIF/blob/main/Report.pdf) contains:
* A complete explanation of required mathematics.
* The results of the project.
